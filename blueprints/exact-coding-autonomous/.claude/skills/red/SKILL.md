# TDD Red Phase

You are now in the **Red Phase** of TDD. Follow these instructions to activate ONE test and make it fail.

## Mandatory Procedure

**All seven steps below are mandatory on every red cycle.**
Predictions (Steps 2 and 5) are not optional even when the
failure looks obvious — they are the measured signal.
Skipping or collapsing a prediction block drops
`predictions_correct_rate` to zero for the cycle and
invalidates the data point. A wrong prediction is
expected output (record `Incorrect` and continue), not a
reason to skip.

## Your Mission

1. Activate exactly ONE test from the test list
2. Make explicit predictions about how it will fail
3. Verify the test fails for the right reason
4. NO implementation during Red phase

## Inputs

The invoker provides:

- **Test file path** — the `.spec.ts` file with the test list
- **Which `it.todo()` to activate** — by description or index
- **Current passing-test count** — for the completion report
- **Implementation file path** — the module under test

## Red Phase Rules

- **One test at a time**: Convert exactly ONE `it.todo()` to executable test
- **All other tests remain as `it.todo()`**: Never have more than one failing test
- **Two-stage failure**: First compilation error, then runtime/assertion error
- **Make predictions**: Explicitly state expected failures before running tests
- **No implementation**: Don't write code to make test pass yet

## Process

### Step 1: Activate One Test

Identify the next `it.todo()` and convert it to executable test code:

```typescript
// Convert from:
it.todo("should return 0 for empty input");

// To:
it("should return 0 for empty input", () => {
  expect(calculate("")).toBe(0);
});
```

Leave all other tests as `it.todo()`.

### Step 2: Predict Compilation Error

Before running the test, state your prediction:

```
Red Phase - Compilation Error Prediction:
- Test: "should return 0 for empty input"
- Expected: Compilation error
- Reason: Function `calculate` doesn't exist yet
- Error: "Cannot find name 'calculate'"
```

### Step 3: Run Test - Verify Compilation Error

Run `pnpm test` and record the actual result. The Step 7
prediction block reports whether the Step 2 prediction
was `Correct` or `Incorrect`. Either way, proceed to
Step 4 — a wrong prediction is a data point, not a
blocker.

### Step 4: Create Empty Function

Create minimal function stub (no logic):

```typescript
export const calculate = (input: string): number => {
  return undefined as unknown as number;
};
```

### Step 5: Predict Runtime Error

Before running again, state your prediction:

```
Red Phase - Runtime Error Prediction:
- Test: "should return 0 for empty input"
- Expected: Runtime assertion error
- Expected value: 0
- Actual value: undefined
- Diff:
  Expected: 0
  Received: undefined
```

### Step 6: Run Test - Verify Runtime Error

Run `pnpm test` and record the actual result. The Step 7
prediction block reports whether the Step 5 prediction
was `Correct` or `Incorrect`. Either way, proceed to
Step 7.

### Step 7: Report Completion

Output the full Step 7 block verbatim with `Correct` or `Incorrect` chosen for each prediction. Keep the two prediction lines separate — do not collapse or abbreviate them.

**Why this format matters:** The block is mechanically parsed to compute `predictions_correct_rate`. The parser expects two lines matching `(- |✅ |❌ )(Correct|Incorrect)` per cycle — one for the compilation prediction, one for the runtime prediction. Collapsing them into a single line, summarizing them as "both correct", or skipping the block entirely drops the predictions count for this cycle to zero. Format consistency here directly drives a metric the experiment measures.

```
Red Phase Complete:
**Test Activated**: "should return 0 for empty input"
**Compilation Prediction**: Cannot find name 'calculate' - Correct
**Runtime Prediction**: Expected 0, received undefined - Correct
**Result**: Test fails as expected with assertion error

Proceeding to Green phase.
```

## Important Guidelines

### DO
- Activate exactly ONE test at a time
- Make explicit predictions before running tests
- Verify test fails for the right reason
- Keep all other tests as `it.todo()`

### DON'T
- Activate multiple tests
- Skip making predictions
- Write implementation to make test pass
- Suppress or rewrite a wrong prediction after seeing the result

## Wrong Predictions Are Data

A prediction can be wrong — that is the point of recording
it. The Step 7 block reports `Correct` or `Incorrect`; the
measurement pipeline aggregates the rate across cycles.

When a prediction was wrong:

- Do **not** edit the original Step 2 / Step 5 prediction
  to match the observed result. The recorded prediction
  must be the one you made *before* running the test.
- Do **not** skip the report block or merge the two
  prediction lines into a summary. The parser needs both
  lines verbatim.
- Do continue the cycle through Step 7. Wrong predictions
  do not block progression — they populate the metric.

## Completion

After completing Red phase, proceed to Green phase:

```
Red Phase Complete. Proceeding to Green phase.
